		<h2>Why Mapping MEDLINE?</h2>
    <p>The biomedical sciences are a a worldwide endeavor, and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed">PubMed</a> contains citations from researchers and clinicians investigating things around the globe. Mapping MEDLINE graphs that geographical diversity by taking
      the results of your PubMed search and displaying them  by country.</p>
    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <p></p>  
      <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html">MEDLINE</a>.
      A big part of that indexing process is assigning each article around 10 to 12 <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/2016/mesh_browser/index.html">Medical Subject Headings</a>.
      For ease of searching it is <em>also</em> possible to narrow your subject search by applying <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/subhierarchy.html">subheadings</a> such as "diagnosis" or "physiology".
      If you are an experienced MEDLINE searcher, you may be used to using these subheadings. What you might not realize however is that is also possible to search using <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/disted/pubmedtutorial/020_730.html">"floating"</a>
      subheadings &mdash; returning results where that subheading is attached to any MeSH heading used to index the record.</p>

      <p>MeSH Subheading Graph takes a MEDLINE search and shows how the subjects in your results stack up against these subheadings. For each search you'll see <em>two</em> graphs &mdash; one showing percentages compared to those for
        all of MEDLINE and another showing relative proportion. Once you have completed at least two searches, you can compare the proportions of one search against another.</p>
      <p>It is instructive to see where the proportions for a given search land. For example, a search for "medicine" returns results where the proportion of subheadings in each category is roughly
        the same as for MEDLINE as a whole. A search for "disease" on the other hand shows a substantial increase in the proportion of results for "etiology" and "diagnosis". Articles about "taxes" show radically different proportions; they
        are mostly indexed by subjects with the subheading "organization and administration".</p>
