		<h2>Why Mapping MEDLINE?</h2>
    <p>The biomedical sciences are a global endeavor, and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed">PubMed</a> contains citations from researchers and clinicians investigating things around the world. Mapping MEDLINE graphs that geographical diversity by taking
      the results of your PubMed search and displaying them by country.</p>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Most citations in PubMed are from MEDLINE, and MEDLINE records are indexed with (typically around 10 to 12) <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/2016/mesh_browser/index.html">Medical Subject Headings</a>. These MeSH headings include not only topic areas but geographic
      regions &mdash; around 15% of all indexed records are tagged with the name of a continent, country or city. Mapping MEDLINE searches your results against these goegraphical headings. Of course some articles might mention a country name in a title or abstract
       <em>without</em> a corresponding index term, so Mapping MEDLINE searches those fields by country name as well.

    </p>
    <h2>Proportional Maps</h2>
    <p>By default, Mapping MEDLINE maps the raw number of results, but it is also possible (by chosing the buttom at the bottom right of your chart) to show a <em>porportional</em> view. This is an way of seeing whether or not there is any significant variation in the prevalence of
      results from one country to another. Mapping that focuses on raw counts alone will tend to bury any regional variations for a search underneath the fact that
    there are just a <em>lot</em> more researchers publishing things in and about some places than there are for others.

  <h2>Comparing proportions</h2>
    <p>Once you have done more than one search, you can compare the proportions for each in a given region.

    <h3>Caveats</h3>
    <p>The scale for each choropleth is variable, so small differences for one search may be represented the same way a larger difference for a different
      search would on another. Because the search for countries is in part a text-word search, false drops are a possibility.</p>

		<h3>Technologies</h3>
		<p>MeSH Subheading Graph is lashed together with bailing wire and and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. It utuilizes NCBI's <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25501/">Entrez Programming Utilities</a> for searching
		PubMed and <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/">Google Charts</a> for visualizing the graphs. Responsive layout made easier with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.</p>
